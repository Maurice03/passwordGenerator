# Password-Generator

The Password-Generator generates the perfect password for your needs. The application uses the programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). All key functions are located in the class <code>Password</code> and executed in <code>Main.kt</code>. To provide adequate security the class <code>Random</code> uses an external [API](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/8160dafd-84e7-4540-b9f1-32e6ecff0409) (shielded by CC BY-SA 3.0 AT) to calculate PRNGs.
